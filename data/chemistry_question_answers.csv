"Why does distilled water not conduct electricity, whereas rainwater does ?
","Distilled water does not conduct electricity because it does not contain any ionic compound (like acids, bases or salts) dissolved in it.
Rainwater, while falling to the earth through the atmosphere, dissolves an acidic gas carbon dioxide from the air and forms carbonic acid (H2CO3). Carbonic acid provides hydrogen ions, H+ (aq) and carbonate ions, CO(aq)32to rainwater. Hence, due to the presence of carbonic acid which provides ions to rainwater, the rainwater conducts electricity."
"Why do acids not show acidic behaviour in the absence of water ?
","The acidic behaviour of acids is due to the presence of hydrogen ions, [H+ (aq) ions], in them. The acid produces hydrogen ions only in the presence of water. So in the absence of water, an acid will not form hydrogen ions and hence will not show its acidic behaviour."

"Equal lengths of magnesium ribbons are taken in test tubes A and B. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to test tube A, while acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to test tube B. In which test tube will the fizzing occur more vigorously and why ?
","Fizzing will occur more vigorously in test tube A. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid whereas acetic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid. Being strong acid, the hydrochloric acid solution contains a much greater amount of hydrogen ions in it due to which the fizzing will occur more vigorously in test tube A (containing hydrochloric acid). The fizzing is due to the evolution of hydrogen gas which is formed by the action of acid on the magnesium metal of magnesium ribbon.

","Oxides and hydroxides of metals and metal like radicals (e.g., NH4+ ions) are called bases. Bases ionise to give OH– ions in aqueous solution. Bases may be soluble or insoluble in water. The soluble bases are called alkalies. Thus all alkalies are bases but all bases are not alkalies.
Examples
NaOH and Cu (OH)2 both are bases, but, since NaOH is soluble in water, it is an alkali. On the other hand, since Cu (OH)2 is insoluble in water, it is not an alkali. Other examples of alkalies are KOH, Ca (OH)2 and NH4OH."

","Butter is a saturated carbon compound while cooking oil is an unsaturated carbon compound. An unsaturated compound decolourises bromine water, while a saturated compound cannot decolourise it. So we can distinguish chemically between a cooking oil and butter by the bromine water. Add bromine water to a little of cooking oil and butter taken in separate test-tubes.

Cooking oil decolourises bromine water showing that it is an unsaturated compound.
Butter does not decolourise bromine water showing that it is a saturated compound"
"Explain the mechanism of the cleaning action of soaps.
","When a dirty cloth is put in water containing dissolved soap, then the hydrocarbon end of the soap molecules in micelle attach to the oil or grease particles present on the surface of dirty cloth. In this way the soap micelle entraps the oily or greasy particles by using its hydrocarbon ends. The ionic ends of the soap molecules in the micelles, however, remain attached to water. When the dirty cloth is agitated in soap solution, the oily and greasy particles present on its surface and entrapped by soap micelles get dispersed in water due to which the soap water becomes dirty but the cloth gets cleaned. The cloth is cleaned thoroughly by rinsing in clean water a number of times.

"How does the electronic configuration of an atom relate to its position in the Modern Periodic Table ?
","Modern periodic table is based on the atomic number and atomic number is directly related to the electronic configuration. One can find the group number and period number of an element on the basis of electronic configuration. For example, if an element has 1 or 2 electrons in its outermost shell, then it would belong to group 1 or group 2. And if it has 3 or more electrons in its outermost shell, then it would belong to group 10 4- the number of electrons in the outermost shell.
All the alkali metals have one electron in their outermost shell, so they are placed in group 1. Thus, all the group 2 elements have 2 electrons in their outermost shell. In group 15 elements, there are 5 electrons in their outermost shell. Similarly, the number of shells in an element indicates its period number. For example, the atomic number of magnesium is 12 and its electronic configuration is 2, 8, 2. Thus it is an element of 3rd period.

d) Copper vessels are best cleaned with tamarind or lemon juice, but not with soap. Why?","a) Green coloured coating on copper is due to the formation of basic copper carbonate, CuCO3.Cu(OH)2.
b) Copper forms green coating of basic copper carbonate as it reacts with water, atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide.
c) Corrosion phenomenon is responsible for the formation of basic copper carbonate (green).
d) Since basic copper carbonate is basic in nature, it can be removed by tartaric acid present in tamarind or citric acid, present in lemon. Soap is basic in nature. So copper vessels are best cleaned with tamarind or lemon."
"Give reasons for the following
i. Silicon counts among metalloids
ii. Carbon is not used for making aluminium from aluminium oxide.
iii. For making hydrogen by reaction with hydrochloric acid, granulated zinc is preferred to a block of zinc","i. Silicon shows properties of both metals and non-metals and hence silicon counts among metalloids.
ii. Carbon has less affinity for oxygen than Aluminium and hence it cannot eliminate oxygen from Aluminium oxide.
iii. Zinc granules are preferred to a block of zinc because it offers a large surface area for the reaction with the acid."

(ii) The colour of Cr3+ ion is green.
(iii) Reducing property of sulphur dioxide is responsible to change the orange yellow colour of K2Cr2O7 to green colour."
"How is chloride of lime chemically different from calcium chloride? Why does chloride of lime gradually lose its chlorine when kept exposed to air?
","Chemically, chloride of lime is calcium oxy chloride, CaOCl2, also called bleaching powder. When exposed to air it gradually lose its chlorine because it reacts with carbon dioxide present in air to produce calcium carbonate and chlorine gas.

"Write short notes on the bleaching action of sulphur dioxide.
","a) Sulphur dioxide bleaches the vegetable colours in the presence of moisture.
b) It bleaches the vegetable colours by reduction. It removes oxygen from coloured material.
c) Its bleaching action is temporary, because atmospheric oxygen again oxidises the bleached article back to its original colour.
d) SO2 is used to bleach delicate fabrics like wool, silk etc."

"a) State why hydrogen is said to be a clean fuel?
b) What property of hydrogen is involved in being a good fuel?
c) What is hydrogenation of oils? Write one application.","a) Hydrogen is a clean fuel because its reaction with oxygen produces only water. It does not form gases like CO2, NO2 etc, which pollute air.
b) Hydrogen, on combustion with oxygen, produces water and a lot of heat. This is an exothermic reaction.
c) Oils are unsaturated molecules, containing double bond. So hydrogen atoms are added at the double bonds of the molecules of oil. The reaction of hydrogen with oils is known as hydrogenation.
The hydrogenation reaction takes place at 473 K and in the presence of nickel catalyst.
Vanaspati or dalda ghee is prepared by hydrogenation of vegetable oils."
"How do metals react with hydrogen? Explain with an example.
","Only very few reactive metals like sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium react with hydrogen to form metal hydrides. Example when hydrogen gas is passed overheated sodium, sodium hydride is formed.
